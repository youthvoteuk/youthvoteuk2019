<h2 id="step-1">Ideas for teachers</h2>

If you are a teacher or a member of staff at a college or school here's some ideas on how you could encourage young people to vote!

 * Ask tutor teams to run tutor time sessions on voter registration, and to email a registration link to all students
 * Find out if links to voter registration sites can be given prominence on the college intranet for students
 * Ask if you can support the students' union, or another student group, to run voter registration stalls at break / lunch time. 
 * If you have students that are keen to run registration stalls themselves, you could point them in the direction of our how to guide. 
 * Find out whether your union group could organise voter registration at break / lunch time. 

A teacher has kindly shared a lesson plan around elections. <a href="/assets/election-lesson-plan.pptx" target="_blank">Download it here</a>. If you have similar plans you are willing to share, please send them our way!

There are teachers involved in our group, so if you have questions or need ideas about how to go about this feel free to [give us a call!](/contact-us)
