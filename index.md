<section class="intro mt-5" markdown="1">
On the 12th December the UK goes to the polls for the most crucial election for years. It will have impacts for decades to come, so it is vital that young people have their voice heard.

In the last election only 55% of 18 to 24 year olds voted vs 85% of over 70s.  According to YouGov “age is the new key predictor of voting intention in British politics”.  Youth turnout could determine the outcome of this election.

**The deadline to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote" target="_blank">register</a> is coming up fast: midnight on the 26th November.** We need to act now to get young people signed up to vote.

You can run a youth voter registration drive in your area. It can be anything from one session, to a whole programme of activities. And, we've made it easy with this step by step guide on how to do it, and free resources to use at your events. 

This is how to do it:
</section>

<section class="section" markdown="1">
<h2 id="step-1"> STEP 1 <br> Do the research </h2>

This one is the easiest! Find your nearest marginal (there are websites you can use to do this) and identify the Further Education colleges, Universities & Shopping Malls in that constituency.

<section class="section" markdown="1">
<h2 id="step-2"> STEP 2 <br> Get your badass crew together! </h2>

Start by choosing the dates you can do between now and November 26th. We have found that lunch time (11.45 to 2pm) is great as all the students are out.

Check [this list](/join-your-local-group) to see if there's already a WhatsApp group for organisers in your area. If not, [contact us](/contact-us) and we can help you set one up.

Now publicise it - make sure to include the WhatsApp group join link, clear dates, start & end time, meeting point and why this is important. You could:

 * Message all your friends and ask them to forward it on
 * Post the details on social media and canvassing Facebook groups
 * Invite people from your local party branch to come along
 * Encourage others to organise dates that you can't make

Getting everyone who is able to attend or interested to join the WhatsApp group really helps with organising effectively. Some groups have also used a 'google sheet' spreadsheet to organise times. You can use [our template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16lFZGg1ynGgUwBBnW196dT9J_kBKl4SATH3lZ2ekrGY/edit?usp=sharing) or create your own.

<section class="section" markdown="1">
<h2 id="step-3"> STEP 3 <br> Prepare your resources </h2>

You don't need much, but we've found that flyers really help. Print some of these if you can, [or give us a call](/contact-us) - we may be able to supply some:

<div class="row">
{%- include flyer.html filename="youthvote-colour" -%}
{%- include flyer.html filename="youthvote-black-and-white" -%}
</div>

<div class="text-center mb-3">
<small><em>Click an image above to download the flyer, or <a href="/assets/flyers/youthvote-colour.pdf" target="_blank">click here for a PDF with 4 flyers per page</a>.</em></small>
</div>

It might also be nice to bring a banner saying 'Register to Vote' so people know what you're up to. If you can, bring snacks, music, a fold out table, or whatever else you may need.

The best way for people to register to vote is online: [www.gov.uk/register-to-vote](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote). It only takes a couple of minutes, and this means people can register then and there on their own device, or on a laptop/tablet that you bring along. 

You can also let people know that they can register for a postal vote: [www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-postal-vote](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-postal-vote).

<h2 id="step-4"> STEP 4 <br> Contact the venue</h2>


#### Shopping Centres / High Streets

If you're going to a shopping centre or another public location,  you can just go along and start chatting to people.

#### FE colleges

Many colleges are keen to get young people registered. Contact them **well in advance** or try to find a sympathetic teachers to help you (politics & citizenship teachers might be particularly keen).

When calling, explain that you are a group of independent campaigners who are holding stalls to encourage young people to vote. Many FE colleges have already hosted such stalls, so ask them whether they would like to welcome you as well.

If it's not possible to organise inside, you can just set up outside and speaking to students as they leave. However, it's always more effective to be inside, so try this first.

If you are a teacher or member of staff at a college or school here are our [tips on how to get started, and some lesson plans](/ideas-for-teachers). 

#### Universities

Try contacting the Students' Union sabbatical officers to discuss this. Many Students' Unions also have a staff member (non-student) dedicated to student participation. See who you can get hold of. 

#### Be strategic

We want to maximise resources, so if you're calling a college or university with a student's union or a supportive member of staff, you could offer to send them the resources and let them take the lead, then you can hit another location!

<h2 id="step-5"> STEP 5 <br> Do it! </h2>


Make sure you have a clear meeting point and turn up in plenty of time. 

Be friendly, tell students that there's an exciting election coming up on December 12th (some people we have spoken with don't even realise the election is coming). If they are 18 or more by the date of the election, they can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote" target="_blank">register to vote</a> before November 26th. 

Remember to take lots of photos and post them on social media using the hashtag **#YouthVoteUK2019** and link to the website to get others involved!

<h2 id="neutrality"> IMPORTANT <br> On neutrality </h2>

Schools and colleges may be less keen to welcome you inside if you're clearly aligned with a particular party. It's important that you emphasise that we're here to encourage young people to vote. But, it's completely fine to talk to young people about why this election matters, the issues that they're interested in, and why they should vote. If you're organising outside a school or college, you have more freedom in how you brand your stall, but you must not brand any electoral materials (like registration forms) with party logos. Plus, we have found that a neutral 'register to vote' message is a good way to open up a conversation with young people.

<h2 id="other-things-you-can-do"> Other things you can do! </h2>

Young people aren't the only ones who are underrepresented on the electoral register. These other projects are registering voters and also need your help.
 * Registering homeless people: <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/get-help/information-for-crisis-members/member-news/how-to-register-to-vote-if-you-re-homeless" target="_blank">www.crisis.org.uk/get-help/information-for-crisis-members/member-news/how-to-register-to-vote-if-you-re-homeless</a>
 * Registering boaters and others with no fixed address: <a href="https://www.mcvoteface.org.uk" target="_blank">www.mcvoteface.org.uk</a>
 * Registering Commonwealth citizens. Commonwealth Citizens of qualifying countries can vote if resident in the UK. Many people don't realise this so tell everyone you know: <a href="https://promotemigrantvote.org.uk" target="_blank">promotemigrantvote.org.uk</a>
